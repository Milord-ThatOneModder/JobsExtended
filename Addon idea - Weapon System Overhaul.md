Addon idea - Weapon System Overhaul
- using lua

rebalanced weapons using spreadsheets
reload mechanics and cooldowns on all guns on changing magazines
realistic magazines - magazines are plastic and metal, so you can see how much bullets you have.
    - lua implementation of deep storage conatiners (the super storage containers)
    - magazines change name, slight tint according to ammo they hold (mabe textures if im not lazy) ( durability = (ammo deep storaged - 1 + 1(the one that isnt deep storaged))/maxammo)%
    - deep storage of ammo, placable on walls and ground, so you can just click on it, click a button and draw a bullets, should look like chests (idk i picture movie lord of death opening)
attachments, but standarized. 1 every type of weapon and in terms of silencers and muzzle breaks are standardrized in ters of caliber of bullets (tldr, realizm but within reason)
guns can break and need repairs
DONT FUCK UP SPAWN AMOUTS, on outposts wrecks etc
keep weapons grounded up in lore, so no sci-fi bullshit like advanced guns from EHA, you can add some alien guns but within reason. also guns has been laced with shit, so it looks worn down, and fitting with game asthetics (light trash-punk)

take all good stuff from COR, EHA, leave things that are shit

mabe:
Combat Expanded (Rimworld) like damage system, based on neurotrauma
do the same for turrets
apply breaking of guns to all armors
add animations for reaload
add postions for that tactical feeling that arma has. take a look at plasma burst 2 and brain-out for inspirations
add rickoshets so shootings inside submarine is very dangerous if you dont check "your angles" (so bullest wont rickoshet to you)
