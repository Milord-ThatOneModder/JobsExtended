Make every class have their version of nuclear pda - That should make people roles more enagaging as they dont need to be in one place (cuz being in one place is not fun, and games are about fun).
Make Navigator have ist own version just for shuttle.
Make every class type (capitan-like, engi role) have their own diving suit and weapons, both mele and ranged (engineers should have only big ass crowbar dmg, freeman like). 
The Exeption is "Commanding Classes", Witch should have its own versions of them, a little more powerfull, but MUCH more expenisve, but only wealded by them. Diving suits should be normal.

new gimmick of "ruling" classes will be aoe buffs (mabe without HoS, cuz idk if i can make it specify targets).

Custodian
	Painting dicks over the sub, yes
	Buildable roomba for cleaning items.
	Mason:
	Maybe janitor could drag bodies faster, have a buffed sprayer tool, come with AOE crew boosts that he applies to rooms
	Everyone should love the janitor
	whenever Janitor uses sprayer, he gets a 10% fixing speed for about 6 seconds
	Janitor could apply a buff with his sprayer to all electrical and mechanical items making them not decay for a set time
	THE CLEANER COULD SPRAY TOXINS

	Maybe this as a talent gun
	




COB should have many technical staff only and physical vessel buffs. Imagine a tinker skill but it lasts several minutes afterwards.


	Random Weapon evey round
	


All talents should have 1 thing to give all people, an weapon, and an diving suit colored accordingly

Themed medals

If a player dies gives you valor

Make Lua command to make someone prisioner

The range of the effects is irrelevant tbh in everything. Making a role in its entirety based on its range is counterproductive but thinking more on a personal talent by talent basis is more effective. You have the right idea with XO but maybe think more like health, speed, and skill boosts.
