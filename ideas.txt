Make every class have their version of nuclear pda - That should make people roles more enagaging as they dont need to be in one place (cuz being in one place is not fun, and games are about fun).
Make Navigator have ist own version just for shuttle.
Make every class type (capitan-like, engi role) have their own diving suit and weapons, both mele and ranged (engineers should have only big ass crowbar dmg, freeman like). 
The Exeption is "Commanding Classes", Witch should have its own versions of them, a little more powerfull, but MUCH more expenisve, but only wealded by them. Diving suits should be normal.

new gimmick of "ruling" classes will be aoe buffs (mabe without HoS, cuz idk if i can make it specify targets).

	Stick flares to harpoons, Flares deal DOT and illuminate target (Maybe later damage exposure?) (Doesnâ€™t attract enemies)

	Remote Navigation Controller; remotely controls navigation terminal OR Shuttle Navigation Controller

	Helmsman
Diver
	Balista gun  - better hapoon gun. - 4st offenive tier, class weapon. added velocity
	pack a punch
	creating achab spears titanium alimunum.  DU spear?. Piercing spear.

	Maybe janitor could drag bodies faster, have a buffed sprayer tool, come with AOE crew boosts that he applies to rooms
	Everyone should love the janitor
	whenever Janitor uses sprayer, he gets a 10% fixing speed for about 6 seconds
	Janitor could apply a buff with his sprayer to all electrical and mechanical items making them not decay for a set time
	THE CLEANER COULD SPRAY TOXINS

	https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695068144&searchtext=talent Maybe this as a talent gun
COB should have many technical staff only and physical vessel buffs. Imagine a tinker skill but it lasts several minutes afterwards.
Random Weapon evey round
All talents should have 1 thing to give all people, an weapon, and an diving suit colored accordingly
Themed medals
If a player dies gives you valor medal
Make Lua command to make someone prisioner
The range of the effects is irrelevant tbh in everything. Making a role in its entirety based on its range is counterproductive but thinking more on a personal talent by talent basis is more effective. You have the right idea with XO but maybe think more like health, speed, and skill boosts.
Tear gas
Passenger BaroPlus integration (alien things)
Mech gets robots
Eng + Mech gets Exoskeleton
Pas gets every small monster tamable
Med gets a special suit based on halo Miolnir undersuit, made from fulgurium, and an egg. Speeds you up, has autoinjector, and a lot of resistances, including husk resistance. (Symbiote suit)
Imagine an overhaul to all electrical and mechanical machines onboard a submarine. What if there was a learning curve and items to boost machines you can use. Oil, coolant, preventative maintenance etc etc. Even adding in new utility items like bildge pumps and placeable items like barocraftables. The creators of those mods have previously given consent towards making a project of such but this never came to fruition.
RobFather#0805: to take it one step further, imagine repairs requiring more tools that influence repairs... ie insulated gloves and screwdrivers that eliminate electrocution risk but increase repair time, multimeters that speed up repair time but are destroyed if you are electrocuted and require batteries, multiple specific wrench sizes required for different pumps, and of course, duct tape which speeds up repair time but increases deterioration rate 
4th talent of a tree gives specialization token, that gives you 1 of 5 talents in line to vanilla skills. then on second one you can get 2nd tier of skill you picked or 1st tier.
add lua inegration, more skills per class engineer gets no max on engineering skill
CO - small buffs, but spanning entire sub
Navigator - small, but combat and gun fire rate oriented
XO - same as CO but smaller
COB - small repair oriented
CMO - small buffs to injecting (?)

Movemnt speed buff when holding a sabre

Split more boring skills to an separwte skill tree, that toy pay with skill points (weapons, eng etc)

Little big planet like processors that can construct logic and then embed itself to a component

Xo, check if cap is alive, rather than to check if he is nea, when kill something gain helm, when steering gain weapons

CO wide area skills weak, but when giving orders you can give more powerfull ones.

Mec 30% chance of getting +1 when ypu fabricate something, drones that defend you

Qua 3 levels of fabricator. + 1 when you fabricate something 80% chance, 50% chancd of getting dobble output when fabricating materials

Eng. More depleted uranium munitions

Joint effort on getting blueprints, either for money or for materials + skill (hacking)

Cob fabrcator specifocly for electric components, + 1 when you fabricate one max 5 times when you complete a mission, better tools (electric screwdriver wrench, multitool), final tiers upgrade suits 

Yaoman more money

Make compatibiloty patches rather than blocking yourself for making features

Try adding 5th hidden talent row that would unlock all talents in this tree, locked behind a "mission" aka an hidden achivment aka kill 100 crawlers

Make guitar holdable in invenory same as acodeon. For engi.

Specialiations for specific jobs: allows unlockong of entire tree, but locks other specialiations.
