Hello, you're here because you're wonder why tf did I the author of this mod didn't copy every single particle from the base game to this mod with a rename.

That's because on June 29th at around 1AM my local time, the entire game crashed with the mod I made over a week's work, deployed on workshop and played with friends.

It was so traumatic I decided to rewrite the mod, but after a good night's sleep and whining inside UTG discord, with the help of Jlobblets and NnnNnn DUCK MAN, I was convinced there's a standard debug method to solving this crash problem. (Again without ANY logs from the game). It involved deleting a lot of paths from filepath.xml but that wasn't it since my assets are pointed as "none".

The problem was me pointing to a cigarette mod's prefab along with the prefab of the default game's particles not gelling well together. So now I have to ""BORROW"" the entire asset of particles
to make guns go bang again. 

Thanks for reading. pls no sue.
