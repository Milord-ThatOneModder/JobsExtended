	<entityname.titansuit>T.I.T.A.N. warsuit</entityname.titansuit>
	<entitydescription.titansuit>If you though A.B.Y.S.S. units were though, wait until you see this beauty of destruction in action. Powered by a portal battery with 10min of use time and charged by the same reactor of a submarine, this suit guarantees the user doesn't die as long as it has power. Small creatures can barely scratch it, big ones have difficulty chewing it. It's slow when used in land, but thanks to the power of propellers, it can keep a good speed in water. The biggest downside is it drains power from the sub to charge, and if it depletes in the middle of the ocean, the chassis breaks and pressure comes right in with a punch. Can contain and recharge all three T.I.T.A.N. weapons.</entitydescription.titansuit>

	<entityname.titanminigun>T.I.T.A.N. 'Shredder' chaingun</entityname.titanminigun>
	<entitydescription.titanminigun>A heavy weapon. Though it's damage per bullet is not really impresive, it holds an impresive ammount of bullets on it's chamber along side an accelerated rate of fire, it becomes a force to be reckon with. The spread though, is far from ideal. Recharged at a T.I.T.A.N. suit</entitydescription.titanminigun>
	<entityname.titanflamer>T.I.T.A.N. 'Depth boiler' flamer</entityname.titanflamer>
