-Updated sprites for the suit and the main contained status
-Removed tiers
	-The features of the tiers are now either baseline or distributed into the power rods
-Organized the folders
-Custom sound for the steps (This is more of a test than anything fancy)
-'Full suit' renamed to 'NPC version'
-'NPC version' no longer has two slots for items
-'NPC version' no loger accepts battery rods
	-Increased base movement speed for the npc version to compensate
	(!)'NPC version' now acts more like a vanilla outfit, it doesn't grant any custom affliction and npc's will wear treat them as any other diving suit
-Changed price to 1000
-Changed the multipliers for each outpost type
-Lights consume energy
-Normalized the movement speed bonus for each battery rod
-Batteries now stack up to 5 (you'll need them)
-Crafting receipe received an overhaul:
	1)You need to decompost (in the fabricator) a suit of each type
	2)Deconstruct the compost to get the needed items for the suit and helmet
	3)Construct the suit using the required components plus some steel and rubber
-Can now only be purchased from the city and military outposts
-Diving suit containers (that are powered) now refuel your oxygen tanks and battery rods
-Fixed helmets having the needle icon instead of the oxygen icon in the container
-Helmet containers now can also be wired to restore oxygen to the helmets
-Affliction "impact dampers" is no longer being used
KNOWN ISSUES:
-Lights don't turn off when there's no battery/battery is depleted
todo:
Increase footstep volume
Helmet lights turns on only when the suit is on and powered?
Restore oxygen for the diving mask?
