Jobs Extended Beta is a realistic, configurable, and more in depth look into roles for Barotrauma. This mod adds in a more realistic set of customizable (and configurable) roles for the crew. Jobs Extended is configurable using karma to permit certain players to pick certain roles, perfect for admins to help control security clearances, griefing, and roleplay (more configuration options soon). See karma section for karma usage.
