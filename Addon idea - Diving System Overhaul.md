advanced diving mod where you have respirators, tanks that arent pocket dimensions, buoyancy vests, fins, weights, as components or modules of diving suits and undersuits for fashion.
also neurotrauma as hard dep, cuz you can burst your lungs

#### Diving suits idea
CrazyIvan#9415 337307802794065932: 
I like this idea: generic dive suit underneath more situation-specific power armor. That way players who run out of power (immobilized) can discard the suit and return to the sub. Hard choices are good.
This kind of already makes sense—if the dive suit went in the Inner Clothing slot rather than Outerwear slot, you could wear body armor or moloch shell or bandolier or a bunch of other things in your Outerwear slot over the suit.
+ Ideas for power suits:
- Combat suit: body armor can fire two two-handed weapons.
- Power Lifter: lets you carry 3 crate/ammo box/depth charges, 1 per hand and 1 on the suit's back.
- Science Suit: integrated sonar, mineral scanner, and thermal goggles. Immune to electrical effects. Maybe stealthy.
- Hazmat suit (i.e. PUCS): immune to Nuclear/Biological/Chemical effects.
- Fire suit: immune to fire. I think EK has this. Not sure what else it should do—integrated flamer or merge with Hazmat?
Obviously these are endgame-level items you work toward over multiple missions because they make you really good.
Also dumping your clothes in the dive locker to put on a dive suit feels right even if they're technically hard drysuits not wetsuits. And it means normal clothes could have bonuses and we wouldn't have to worry how those interact while diving.
CrazyIvan#9415 337307802794065932: With baro-modding it's easy to mod a diving suit so it can carry crates/ammo boxes/etc on its back; the downside is modding doesn't support showing the contained item for wearables the way it does for holdables like the welder's fuel tank or smg's magazine. So you can't tell that the suit is carrying a ton of stuff, which kind of breaks immersion for me.
What looks good is having an item in your character's hand that can hold the crates; then you can actually see them. Obviously that's overpowered on its own, so there'd need to be some way to prevent someone from using those hand controllers without also wearing the suit. I think the clown gear's approach to giving the character the clown tag could work: wearing the suit gives you the "exoskeleton" tag, and the hand controllers don't let you use them unless you have that tag. Something like that.
Pretty sure EK has some hand cart you can "push" around. That works, but makes me feel more like a porter than a badass in an exoskeleton.

I just created a GitHub Discussion to enable this kind of modding: https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/discussions/9621

more advanced diving suits would require specialized underclothing, upgraded from base clothing, if you dont have it you take damage with each step, and you move slower
