Hey, does the Apprenticeship talent, and other talents related to it (journeyman, loyal assistant) currently interact with the custom jobs? If not, would it be possible to make it that so that it interacts with the whole related wing you are specializing in? E.g. security covering HoS, Diver and Security Officer. Captain specialization covering CO, XO and Navigator and so on.
